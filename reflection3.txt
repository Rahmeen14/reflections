How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

---->>> The staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and repository.
It holds all changes made to files in the working directory before it is logically sane to commit them.
I feel it does have value to offer as lesser frequent commits are required. Also, multiple files can be committed together!
